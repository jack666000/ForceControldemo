ForceControldemo 
The composition of ForceControl configuration software includes: development system Draw, interface running system View, and database system DB. Draw and View mainly complete the configuration and operation of the human-machine interface, and DB mainly completes the real-time data collection of the process (through I/O driver program), real-time data processing (including alarm processing, statistical processing), historical data processing, etc.

The basic steps to develop a system are:

Establish database point parameters and connect data to parameter points;

Establish window monitoring screens and establish animation connections for various graphic objects in the monitoring screens;

Compile script programs to analyze curves, alarms, and report production to complete a simple configuration development process.
